# UoB_Challange02a
initial commit


# one-page portfolio #
* simplicity and clean forms
* name shown up in the header
* navigation should lead to specific parts
 -> TBC how to manage "Projects" leading to the sections below when clicked?
 -> "About" and "Contact me" should not be shown in  the navigation, as these sections are just below the header - TBC (maybe CV link instead should be use?)

# Grids and nested grids ##
* 'About me' presents an avatar and a short text
* 'Contact me' contains an image, email and GitHub link
* Below - projects showcase containing 6 example proejcts

* footer just informa about who created the web page
